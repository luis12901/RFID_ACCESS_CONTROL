# RFID Access Control Project

This repository contains the code and documentation related to the RFID Access Control project developed for [University of Guadalajara].

## Description

The project aims to implement an efficient and secure access control system using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. The system enables authorized users to access rooms and enclosed areas quickly and conveniently, eliminating the need for manual and time-consuming processes.

## Key Features

- Authentication and access authorization using RFID cards and NFC devices.
- Bidirectional communication between an ESP32 board and a local server using HTTP protocol and JSON messages.
- Integration of a MySQL database for secure storage of user information and access records.
- Incorporation of a pyroelectric sensor to detect human presence in the space and activate the automatic lock.
- Solar panels with a sun tracker to provide sustainable energy to the system.

## Repository Structure

- **/Code**: Contains the project's source code, including scripts for ESP32 and PHP files for the server.
- **/Documentation**: This folder holds all project-related documentation, such as user manuals, diagrams, and other resources.
